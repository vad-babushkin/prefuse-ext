/**
 * This package contains some auxiliary classes which could be useful
 * also in other projects with little or no change. 
 * <p>
 * Classes {@link idot.util.DotFileReader} and {@link idot.util.DotFileWriter} 
 * are used to load and save graphs stored in a limited subset 
 * of the <em>dot</em> format.
 * {@link idot.util.InvertedWheelZoomControl} is used to provide the feature of zooming
 * the {@link idot.DotDisplay} with the mouse wheel. 
 * {@link idot.util.MultilineTextItemRenderer} and {@link idot.util.TransitionRenderer} 
 * are used for drawing the states and transitions on the display, 
 * and {@link idot.util.NearBSpline} is used by the latter to assist in drawing 
 * smooth curves. 
 * <p>
 * {@link idot.util.ExtensionFileFilter} is a simple filter for filtering files in file
 * selection dialogs based on their extensions.
