        iDot - Incremental Dot Viewer

iDot enables incremental display of directed graphs written 
in the dot language of Graphviz (http://graphviz.org). The jar 
file for the prefuse graphics library and minimal executables 
for dot are included in the distribution.

iDot was developed for use with the SpinSpider software tool
for automatically generating state diagrams from Promela
programs in Spin, and the VN software tool for generating
computations in nondeterministic finite automata.

When a dot file is opened, the first node will be displayed.
The following operations can be performed with the mouse:
  * Double-click on a node to display the nodes directly
    accessible from that node.
  * Drag and drop a node or an edge to rearrange the layout.
  * Left-press on the canvas to pan the graph.
  * Right-press on the canvas to zoom the graph.
    The mouse wheel can also be used.

Toolbar commands:
  * Show all / Show Open - toggles between showing the entire
      graph and showing nodes that have been "opened" incrementally.
  * Redo - restore the initial layout.
  * Edit - edit the dot file; the changes can be saved and applied.
  * Export - export the current image in a variety of formats.
